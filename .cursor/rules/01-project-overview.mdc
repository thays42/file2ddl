# File2DDL Project Overview

File2DDL is a command-line tool that analyzes delimited files and infers PostgreSQL data types for each column. The project is written in Go and consists of a single main package.

## Main Components

- [main.go](mdc:main.go): Contains the core implementation including:
  - Command-line interface
  - File analysis logic
  - Data type inference
  - Type validation functions

- [main_test.go](mdc:main_test.go): Contains test cases for the implementation

- [testdata/](mdc:testdata/): Directory containing test files used in unit tests

## Key Features

1. Analyzes delimited files (CSV, TSV, etc.)
2. Infers PostgreSQL data types for each column
3. Supports common data types in order of preference:
   - boolean
   - smallint
   - integer
   - bigint
   - numeric
   - timestamp
   - date
   - text (fallback type)
4. Handles common date and timestamp formats
5. Validates input parameters

## Usage

The tool is used via command line with two required parameters:
- `-file`: Path to the input file
- `-delim`: Single character used as field delimiter

Example:
```bash
file2ddl -file data.csv -delim ","
```
